     “HORRORS IN THE COURT”

      DETAILS PROVING FRAUD AND RACKETEERING
					By Tom Opdahl

    1.  Plaintiff Lorentz G. Opdahl retired in 1979 and had placed most of his assets in various common law trusts modeled after those formed by Karl Dahlstrom 
whose trusts proved legitimate after extensive litigation. The Internal Revenue Service contends they are shams to defeat creditors, including the IRS.  Some 
of his assets included an investment in a Foreign Bank and deposits.  These transfers were alleged to be made to obstruct payment to the IRS for taxes.  Included 
in the numerous trusts was one company, Tri-State Refining Company where the certificates were owned by the main trust named Sioux Enterprises modeled after Opdahl's 
previous corporation named Sioux Fertilizer which originally owned the silver company by virtue of it's investment along with Opdahl's other personal asset contributions.

    2.  The sting against Opdahl and patriots could not get off the ground unless the U.S. Attorney's office would work with Robert Hoff in gaining additional 
information for prosecution and using Hoff as a lever with an impending judgment to force Opdahl to come to the bargaining table; the intent of the U.S. Attorney's 
office all along was to charge  Opdahl and others with bribery in the hope of seeking long prison terms.

   3. Judge Haltom was informed of the conspiracy as he knew he had to refuse to allow any information into trial about the black Mayor and attempts to entrap him, 
about the FBI agents promoting real estate developments and any information about Opdahl's actual tax liability as analyzed by a C.P.A. 

    4. The 1979 tax figures for Opdahl and his family, including both  Lorentz and Thomas were first exaggerated and later grossly overstated.  Initially Robert Amick, 
IRS agent on 1/19/83 assessed Thomas an additional undistributed taxable income of $ 2,124 for the 10 % share of Sioux Fertilizer stock.  This calculates to $ 21,240 
total fertilizer additional income.  Additionally, Amick incorrectly assessed dividends of $9,000 as taxable income knowing that Subchapter S dividends not exceeding 
the percent of ownership times the previous years undistributed taxable income, if paid within the first two and one half months (this presumably includes accounting 
entries as dividends payable at the start of the year) are not reportable as income on the shareholders return. As such Amick was incorrect in taxing Thomas on those 
dividends. Shortly thereafter on April 1, 1983 Amick assessed $7,444.08 additional undistributed taxable income which calculates out to $74,440.80 total Sioux Fertilizer 
additional income.  On June 28, 1983 Thomas tendered a check for full payment of this alleged $4,546 additional tax for Thomas' portion, only Amick refused to sign an 
affidavit that such was "true and correct under penalties of perjury", presumably because he knew they might be incorrect.  Amick's treatment was overstated, but not grossly.  However it was still greatly in error.  Amick erred in not using the Amended Return as the starting point.  Amick erred in trying to reduce Cost of Goods Sold when the perpetual inventory records for the fertilizer company were kept by the assistant manager and gave very accurate cutoffs at any given time.  Amick erred in not identifying each and every item disallowed as a Cost of Goods Sold deduction.  Having recorded the 1979 results twice; once only 10 cents off, the only error for the year to Thomas' knowledge, is crediting Cost of Goods Sold for a $55,000 stock sale.  So, rightfully, Amick should have increased Cost of Goods Sold by $55,000, decreased ordinary income by $55,000, reported a capital gain and returned a refund for the difference.  Instead IRS agents, under the direction of certain IRS attorneys, chose to assess Lorentz over $142,000 for 1979 and Thomas $10,846.55 later reduced to over $7,500. Such assessments were grossly overstated, PRECEDED BY CAREFUL SILVER COMPANY ANALYSIS, as follows:

      The Silver Company Records were obtained by Thomas L. Opdahl, C.P.A. in April 1980 when being fired by ROBERT HOFF WHO first threw the most  important records in his 
face from across the room about 12 feet or more. Thomas L. Opdahl, C.P.A. picked them up and placed them in a HOFF'S BRIEF CASE, ripped open and thrown by HOFF in anger, 
with his briefcase and backpack.

    5.  Tri-State Refining Company was operated or managed by Robert Hoff with no interference by Opdahl, but with the oral promise that once the initial investments were 
returned amounting to slightly more than $134,000, then Tri State Refining would be 50% owned by Robert Hoff.  In reality only $10,270.50 of gold coins were returned so 
that the later quoted $223,339 Purchase price was $123,000 for the initial investment and $100,000 for the 50% value of the company.  Hoff deceived the Court and various 
IRS agents into believing that he owned 50% of the company from inception and that he consequently was purchasing only a 50% equity in the company at $223,339.

    6.  Tri State Refining as a trust had nothing to do with cheating the IRS, as it appears that Hoff operated the company in such a fashion to cheat as many people as 
possible including the IRS.
	7.  Thomas Opdahl as a recent C.P.A. in 1977 started keeping crude monthly records in the form of T accounts with no beginning balances.  This was assisted by 
the preparation of monthly listings of expenses and revenues until April 1980.

    8.  On July 7, 1978, a thorough inventory was taken by Hoff which Thomas Opdahl plugged into the known costs, expenses and revenues to date, only to find an apparent 
discrepancy of over $140,000 which Thomas Opdahl inadvertently assumed to be the result of no beginning T account balances and hence made an appropriate accounting entry 
to fix the discrepancy.  In retrospect since August 1995, it appears that Hoff succeeded in siphoning over $140,000 within four years without Opdahl finding out or suspecting a thing.

    9.  Between July 1978 and March 1979, Thomas Opdahl made several simple bookkeeping errors in favor of the IRS and accidentally overstated cash sales by over $34,000.

    10. On March 31, 1979, Thomas Opdahl mistakenly over-stated the ending Accounts Receivable by over $56,000 by not deducting cash collections against receivables as he
 was in haste of getting acceptable results as hurriedly as possible.  This overstated income by such a figure.

    11.  By December 26, 1979 Tri State made it's last bullion shipment till after the collapse of the silver market in March 1980, with only FOUR pounds of silver inventory 
remaining.  At this approximate time, Opdahl agreed to furnish additional financing, later amounting to $475,000 with the implied agreement that the inventory would be 
stockpiled for later production.  Also indirectly connected with inventory at this time was the following silver receivable balances expressed in ounces as sent to another 
Refiner for later collection in cash:

Assuming that one half of these collections were used to buy scrap silver and gold and the other half for more silver purchases-- this would give about a $100,000 profit 
on scrap gold and leave approximately $122,560.35 more silver purchases @ the approximate exact cost of aquisition of $20.15-----------6,082.40 Jan actual 442,985.43 + Feb 
act 125,342.50 + Feb est 125,342.50 = $ 693,352.23 + unavailable first week march est $50,000 + payables $50,000 = $793,352.23 - $475,000 loaned - $194,223.79 bought with 
scrap gold = $124,128.44 as reasonable estimate.  The statements furnished Frank Lavia show the following total medallion sales for 1980 of------------------------

Assuming that 20% are sold in first week of March 1980 and remainder sold @ 14 average price then about 2,933 medalions are sold in march and part of April, perhaps 
as many as 3000 medallions in total. At least 1500 were made by the end of Feb
 -----------------------------------2,933.00

The statements furnished Frank Lavia show the following total 100 ounce bars sold expressed in dollars  $10,461.75 and using the same 20 @ formula at $ 40 and the
remainder at $13 gives an estimated 568 ounces but it could only be an approximate round figure so it is estimated-------600.00

The statements furnished Frank Lavia show the following total 10 ounce bars sold expressed in dollars   $11,889.84 and using the same percentages as the 100 ounce bars 
this gives 646.2 ounces; but since the 100

SILVER LEFT IN TRI-STATE REFINING TO STEAL (by anybody) AFTER PAYING CREDITORS-1,191.94 valued at $14 = $16,729.16,
but with over $ 31,000 of other payables----------------------------------_____________

HOWEVER THE ABOVE ANALYSIS IS SLIGHTLY INCORRECT SINCE TRI-STATE CAN'T INCLUDE THE 5432 OUNCES PAID AS INVENTORY AND THE AMOUNT REFINED FROM THE STUPID CRAP AT 3300 OUNCES 
BOTH; ONLY ONE CAN BE INCLUDED CORRECTLY- Bob Hoff incorrectly included the 5432 ounces when arriving at 38,000 total inventory about 3/31/80. THE LATTER;  SO IT SEEMS 
THE WOMAN IRS AGENT AS EAST TESTIFIED DURING THE TRIAL IN ANALYZING TRI-STATE'S RECORDS WAS CORRECT IN ASSUMING THAT PERHAPS THERE WAS A NEGATIVE BEGINNING INVENTORY.   
The price the silver was sold may alter the results slightly; but the costs are fairly constant as the $20.15 cost figure was arrived at by carefully combining the January, 
February and March 1980 Refining statements with the actual costs of each item corresponding the ounces of product added to  production to prevent errors of double counting 
etc that had caused some problems in getting a $22 or more average cost when the earlier estimates were from  $19.83 to 20.85 for January alone before pinning down each 
inventory item to prevent errors;  Opdahl used $20 as a  figure for calculations in negotiations as it was closest to the final result obtained and Hoff knew why the $20 
figure was used for he was privy to such Cost of Production Statements. A 37,851.00 12/31/79 overdraft at National Bank of South Dakota helps insure a negative inventory.

    13.  East testified that an IRS employee working backwards from an approximate 10,000 ounce inventory in December 1980 arrived at a possible negative April 1980 inventory; which is entirely possible with Hoff's method of siphoning money out for himself and in light of the fact that the minting press was paid for in silver in presumably February of which internal accounting records showed a 1745 ounce variance that was in retrospect most likely due to Hoff's removing such inventory of the 2200 ounces paid for the minting press without writing down the removal, making less net inventory available by April 8, 1980.

    14 a. One may argue that certainly there were more revenues in Tri- State in 1980 that would have allowed more April 1980 inventory. Examining  the statements 
furnished Frank Lavia, one sees that there were some and working backwards there was the following additional revenues:    
    	Rent			      $3,129.25
     Amalgam       		$22,587.58 
Less gold refined in 1979-$2,130.31
                                       __________
				$20,457.27 
    			      ____________	
                                        $23,586.52								     
However the $37,851.00 overdraft (per book balance) on 12/31/79 would have quickly eaten that up.  Additionally there were the following sales:

Machine Sales:				$17,992.71
Coin Sales for January, February,
March to April 8                                $679,260.06

And working backwards from the reported purchases of $3,592,082.15 and deducting nine months of 1979 purchases of $2,330,389.50 = ----------$1,261,692.65 of total purchases
 for January, February and March to April 8 which taken the known amounts expended for the purchase silver in the above analysis are $275,000 for Sioux Enterprises, $200,000 
from  the bank loans, $100,211.75 and $94,012.04 from gold and silver scrap  sales, $17,972.40 for increased silver bought as a result of early  medallion and silver sales 
income in February, $122,560.35 from 1979 silver bullion collections and $30,509.94 as a result of increased silver purchases from the final bullion sale; THIS GIVES A 
COMBINED PURCHASES FOR COINS AND MACHINES IN EARLY 1980 OF $421,426.17 gives a whopping gross profit of $275,826.60 but is reduced by $720 to reflect the change between 
beginning machine inventory and ending: However from this Tri-State must deduct $130,605.12 as the ending 12/31/79 Accounts payable paid during this  period and $5,000 for
merchandise in transit on 3/31/80 that has been paid  during the period: furthermore we must deduct another $60,000 for Hoff's purchase of the lake property on ____________
______ when he sent Crane a check for the balance owing on metals sold in Crane's behalf.  Of note over $16,000 of this had been deposited by Linda Opdahl Hoff earlier. This 
leaves about  $79,501.52 of additional revenues which were probably utilized to buy more silver at the cost of production of $20.15 or 3,886.03 additional ounces. Thus we 
take the 1194.94 and add 3886.03 and add back in the amount of silver required to repay the bank at $14 estimated price of $14,245.01 and we get 19,325.98 Troy ounces of 
inventory remaining; but which at least 3,300 ounces are more than likely in Chicago with a considerable delay at getting payment.					     

	14 b.  Thomas Opdahl provided Frank Lavia, IRS criminal investigator  with a fairly accurate statement as to the position of Tri-State on April 8, 1980 showing 
approximately 19,522.10 ounces remaining in inventory after paying some of its creditors, namely Sioux Enterprises.  The IRS mis-interpreted such results and assumed Opdahl
 received 17,500 ounces in the buyout and failed to comprehend that Hoff was practicing a method of cheating the company which we wouldn't tolerate; forcing Opdahl to 
sever ties with Hoff and Tri-State.  The previous analysis showed about 19,325.98 ounces and if any reputable IRS agent properly analyzed the statements, they could very 
easily see that it would be impossible to have $150,000  or $200,000 of silver to steal; there was more than likely about $17,500  of silver with about $31,000 of ending 
other payables or bills which had  to be sold to pay those bills; SO IN FACT THE SILVER COMPANY WAS INDEED ON THE VERY VERGE OF BANKRUPTCY. And the U.S. Attorney's office 
needn't conspire with Hoff for they will indeed be exposed.

    14 c. Thomas in arriving at the 19,522.10 ounces used perhaps an incorrect method of obtaining such.  Thomas carefully examined all the pure silver medallion sales 
after 3/31/80 up to April 8 and deducted those from Hoff's presumably accurate 38,000 ounce figure.  Then knowing that approximately 4,700 ounces of good pure silver 
had been shipped to Connie Berry, he looked around for the closet figure in his accounting records that was reported as any old account balance and deducted that instead 
of the actual known amount as of 3/31/80 in order to make the IRS stumble in trying to figure how he got such an exact figure.  In reality, Thomas was not allowed into 
the Refinery after 3/31/80 and apparently didn't have the ounces of the final shipment and forgot all about it. But the answer came out the same to around 4,800 ounces, 
the SIZE OF A NORMAL WEEKLY SHIPMENT OF SILVER. Thomas' response at obtaining such a figure was of course, "that's close enough for the preliminary report to f’ing IRS." 
Note the only 1.004 percent error between reported and this final analysis. What could be closer, considering the fact that Robert was controlling the records.  Later

    15. Instead Eric Jorgenson and others acted in such a fashion with intentional overstatement of tax liabilities owing by Opdahl and his family in violation of 
26 U.S.C. 7214.  On the afternoon of Friday March 13, 1987 Eric Jorgenson called Thomas Opdahl at the Brandon, South Dakota video store to both inform Thomas of an 
upcoming IRS Tax Court hearing and threaten Thomas that "if your father doesn't come to Tax Court, there will be a big judgment against him.  Thomas replied that the 
IRS is being openly dishonest in assessing a $200,000 deposit by someone else in his Foreign Bank as income.  Prior to this time Thomas had no such notification 
concerning himself and was difficult to pin down due to his extensive travel of 2000 miles a week and working very long hours of 100 hours each week.  However on 
March 16, 1987, the IRS office in Ogden, Utah charged Thomas with an over $95,000 tax on a similar $200,000 Deposit as revealed in a Notice of Assessment rubber 
stamped September 4, 1986.  Thomas having no such knowledge on March 13th, it appears obvious that Jorgenson called the Ogden, Utah office on Monday March 16th to 
also fraudulently include a $200,000 deposit by someone else into his father's Foreign Bank as income on Thomas's return in violation of 26 U.S.C.7214 and showing 
contempt for Thomas's constitutional rights.  Since the Ogden office did not mail such notice until March 19th, it appears obvious that insufficient time was given 
before the scheduled Tax Court hearing on April 20; so that Thomas could respond; and the almost certain likelihood that such Notice of assessments dated April 1985 
and September 1986 were not sent until after April 20 and most likely on or after July 15, 1987 in order to prevent Thomas from refuting IRS claims at Opdahl's perjury 
trial in Wyoming.  Incidentally, Thomas responded to IRS demands in July 1985 and made no mention of such $200,000 deposit being claimed as income by the IRS at the time.  
In any event, the 1983 income amounts on Opdahl's tax returns were grossly overstated as well as the 1980 amounts allegedly assessing income for Tri State Refining; 
when in fact the IRS knew of the silver market collapse and the possible remaining net inventory available and that such claims were knowingly false and unlawful demands.  
Yarbrough, Snyder and Holder assisted in such deceptive practices.
    16. Shortly after the April 20, 1987 Tax Court hearing that Opdahl cancelled and failed to attend, an unknown IRS agent, Cooper or Barnett overseeing the sting 
operation persuaded Moussallem to contact Spulak and use him to dupe Opdahl out of $15,000 on a pretended plan of being Opdahl's initial payment for taxes due to his 
stubborness to attend.   This Spulak was able to do; but with the recourse that once the dishonesty of certain IRS agents was discovered, Opdahl forced Spulak to sign 
a $15,000 Note for the balance, which unfortunately is equal to the value of his stock in the Foreign Bank, leaving Opdahl 100% owner of the Foreign Bank. Interestingly
 Judge Nims issued some order allegedly his Judgment being as the IRS had demanded; Unfortunately for the IRS, they finally arrived at some figures some six months later 
after the Judge’s decision; that might work for ordinary folks, but not for A FOREIGN BANKER whose son is a CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANT.
    17.  Moussallem persuaded Opdahl to make payments towards his family's IRS tax liabilities and furnished him with information so Cooper could ascertain a settlement 
amount; Sometime during the summer of 1987 Cooper, Moussallem and Opdahl met and Cooper agreed to a $120,000 settlement amount, plus the $169,000. Co-incedentally, Opdahl's 
CPA later analyzes the IRS demands and calculates, based on his information, that Opdahl owed approximately $80,000, instead of the falsely and fraudulently assessed 
amounts of 1.2 million dollars which Haltom refused to allow this CPA to testify or else he would ruin the government's case against Opdahl.  Moussallem received a portion 
in excess of the $120,000 amount which Cooper acknowledges as his pay by August and/or November 1987 as he laughs about it on the phone when talking to Moussallem.
    18.  Moussallem paid the $120,000 to Cooper during the first week of November when Opdahl was in prison at Leavenworth on perjury charges. Cooper had been personally 
selected by the IRS and U.S. Attorney's office and purposefully used Moussallem to seek Spulak in order to sting Opdahl.  Moussallem was initially contacted on August 20 
by a useful method of having Bud Reid refer to him as Lasalom in order to cover up the fact that Opdahl is the prime target of the sting.  Incidentally, Hoff amended his 
complaint on August 18, 1986, giving the IRS and U.S. Attorney's  office two days to find Moussallem as their middleman agent.

   19a.  The actions of Cooper as Revenue Agent with settlement authority in reviewing IRS documents of Opdahl's family and having settlement authority as he assured 
Opdahl resulted in a valid and legal compromise  and settlement in spite of the corrupt activities within the U.S.  Attorney's office.
   19b. The reasonableness of the $120,000 collected by Cooper for Opdahl's family's tax liabilities and the analyses of Ken Murphy, C.P.A. suggest that such a figure 
was entirely acceptable to the Internal  Revenue Service.  On July 11, 1989 Murphy issued a letter that Opdahls  tax liabilities for 1979 through 1985 and 1986,1987 
and 1988 showed about $75,000 owing.  On October 26, 1989 after carefully reanalyzing  everything, Murphy concluded that Opdahl owed $125,000 and later that the 
Internal Revenue Service was definitely overpaid with $290,000.
    20.  The actions of various IRS Revenue officers regarding Thomas's IRS Notices of Tax Liens prior to the November settlement date show a pattern of over-assessing 
and extorting sums of money from Opdahl.
    21.  The actions of various IRS Revenue Officers regarding Lorentz's Notices of Tax Liens after the November settlement date show a disdain of Lorentz's constitutional 
rights and clearly done to either prevent Opdahl from lessening his losses, or to allow various authorities to seize property or funds not properly belonging to the IRS 
resettlement.
    22.  The actions of various attorneys, judges and others in upholding a fraudulent judgment are nothing more than the actions of a racketeer and accordingly should
 be punished.
    23.  The actions of various agents of the U.S. Government who cover up such fraud against Opdahl are nothing more than the actions of a racketeer and accordingly 
should be punished.

Or or BETWEEN VIRGIL VAN STELTON UNTO AS WITH ALSO WITH TOM OPDAHL
BELOW AS ALSO AS “BEING” ALSO AN ALMOST EXACT REPLICA OF ORIGINAL FEDERAL COURT 'filing' 
1. Tom Opdahl made both a $27,000 error in accounts payable, in not using a calculator, in adding up the posting adjustment for a month preceding 3/31/79 and a similar 
$39,000 error in accounts receivable, in the same manner and fashion, as above. These errors immediately affected total sales with the combined error, not in favor of 
the IRS, making a total adjustment of $56,000, as alluded in this complaint, written exactly three years ago from this court filing.

2. In addition, a net total of $140,000 of purchases exceeded sales on 3/31/79 when the silver refining assets were placed in trust (there were that many more purchases 
of metal products that were not showing as sales after processing, i.e., they were “missing”). This was later commented to Bob Hoff in the 218 N Phillips Avenue Office 
of Tri-State, sometime between May 1979, after renting the office, possibly very shortly after commencing full time cost accounting duties for Tri-State Refining. 
Bob was sitting in his chair, at the very back desk, on the north side of the Office, while I (Tom) was at the corresponding opposite side, back desk, where I was doing
 most of all accounting work, (I would also use the front most desk, about one-third from the back of the Office; the back office room with the water cooler and safe 
for storing smaller sums of silver coins and/or gold coins and/or very small gold bullion bars), as mentioned in subsection three. I (Tom) told Bob Hoff of the $140,000 
discrepancy in the books, affecting inventory of possible missing amounts of such inventory, later adding, “it was probably an error in my bookkeeping”. At first bob was 
worried and upset, and turned his chair on wheels to face me, clutching the arms of the chair, and with big bold eyes asked, for the first time, "DID YOU TELL YOUR DAD?". 
Then rising to go to the back Office, he invited me to the back room to discuss inventory matters. Standing about six feet from the back Office, facing the door, he asked 
for a second time "ARE YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T TELL YOUR DAD?" AT WHICH I REPLIED FOR THE FIRST OR SECOND TIME, SAYING "YES, I'M SURE I DID NOT TELL DAD ABOUT THE DISCREPANCY 
OF $140,000”. UPON BOB HOFF HEARING THAT FOR THE SECOND TIME, HE HEAVED A VERY NOTICABLE BIG SIGH OF RELIEF. Then Bob, pointing to the safe, said that he keeps small amounts
 of gold and silver in the (fairly) large upright safe, and quickly added, “he keeps the invoices for the sales and keeps track of the Office inventory but needs someone
 to keep track of, mostly, silver inventory at the plant or refinery on the Hudson farm. Finally, standing in the back door, with me halfway to my back desk, he asked for 
a third time, "ARE YOU CERTAIN YOU DIDN'T TELL YOUR DAD?”, implying about the large discrepancy. AND WITHOUT TURNING AROUND I SHRUGGED MY SHOULDERS UP A LITTLE, ASSUMING 
I HAD MADE A HUGE MISTAKE IN BOOKEEEPING, AND SAID "NO, I DID NOT TELL MY DAD". TURNING AROUND, I SAW BOB HOFF WALKING PLEASED WITH HIMSELF BACK TO HIS REAR DESK CHAIR, 
AS CHERYL JOHNCK OF INTERNATIONAL DIAMONDS HAD RELINQUISHED HER OFFICE SUB-RENTAL DUE TO PROBABLE ADVANCES TO HER, A MARRIED WOMAN AND WIFE OF TRI STATE'S BANKER. TO ANYONE 
WITHOUT MENTAL ILLNESS AND SEEING BOB HOFF'S EYES ALMOST POP OUT OF HIS HEAD AT THE FIRST QUESTION ASKED BY BOB HOFF, AND HIS REPEATED QUESTIONING FOR ASSURANCE, 
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS THAT BOB HOFF WAS STEALING MASSIVELY FROM THE COMPANY.

3. THE THIRD OCCASION, AND SECOND CONVERSATION WITH BOB HOFF, HAPPENED, AS FOLLOWS, UPON AND AFTER THE 4/8/80 FIRING OF TOM OPDAHL, as accountant for the SiIver Refinery 
Business: AFTER BOB HOFF ORALLY AGREED TO BUY THE SILVER REFINERY FOR $ 2,951.44 A MONTH, FOR TEN YEARS, OF WHICH ONLY SIX YEARS OF PAYMENTS WERE MADE WITH AND INCORPORATED 
INTO THE LATER, SIGNED ON AUGUST 28, 1980 "PURCHASE AND SALE AGEEMENT", PREPARED BY HARRY GREGERSON, THERE WAS A CLAUSE IN WHICH ROBERT HOFF AGREED TO TURN OVER ALL 
ACCUMULATED ASSETS IN THE EVENT OF NON-PAYNENT OF THE MONTHLY REQUIRED PAYMENTS, ACCORDING TO THE SIGNED CONTRACT. AFTER WORKING FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES DOING ACCOUNTING, 
HE STOPPED ME AND SAID, “YOU CAN STOP DOING WHAT YOUR DOING BECAUSE YOU'RE FIRED". I AT FIRST OBJECTED, BUT HE SAID THAT, “NOW THE SILVER REFINERY WAS HIS". EVENTUALLY, 
I STARTED TO CRY AND HE ASKED ME, “WHAT FOR?" AND I REPLIED, “BECAUSE THE SILVER REFINERY HAD MADE A MILLION DOLLARS AND LOST IT ALL IN THREE WEEKS". I STILL STARTED TO 
CRY AND TOLD HIM THAT “IF I HAD A GUN I MIGHT HAVE SHOT A HIGHWAY PATROLMAN, GIVING ME A TICKET FOR SPEEDING AND MAKING ME SEE A JUDGE, AS I WAS 20 MILES OVER THE LIMIT".
 The judge was nice about it and said keep your speed down to the limit, or else you might hurt someone or yourself, at which I agreed. BUT BOB HOFF SAID “YOU WOULD 
PROBABLY GO TO PRISON FOR KILLING SOMEONE”. I SAID I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE IN YOUR SHOES WITH SO MUCH PAYMENT AND LACK OF CAPITAL. HE BRAGGED THAT “HE HAD MONEY THAT 
LORENTZ DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT AND BRAGGED THAT HE WOULD BE MUCH RICHER THAN YOUR DAD AND THAT DAD WOULD BE A PAUPER COMPARED TO HIM”; AND ADDED “HE WILL PROBABLY SPEND 
THE REST OF HIS LIFE IN PRISON". I SAID HOW CAN THAT BE? HE SAID, “MAYBE I WILL TURN HIM INTO THE IRS.” AT WHICH I REPLIED, MAYBE I'LL BEAT YOU TO IT. MAYBE I WILL 
TURN HIM IN TO THE IRS BEFORE YOU CAN. HE ASKED, “WHAT FOR?” AND I REPLIED MAYBE THERE IS MORE INCOME THAN I KNOW ABOUT. HE ASKED, “HOW MUCH MORE INCOME?” I PONDERED 
IN MY HEAD FOR ABOUT 5 SECONDS (ADDING UP A SIMILAR $140,000 FERTILIZER BARGE PURCHASE THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IMPROPERLY REPORTED IN THE CORRECT YEAR ENDINGS INVENTORY 
AND THE $80,000 PREPAID AMMONIA PURCHASE THAT I HAD SECRETLY, ALMOST, OMITTED FROM INVENTORY BUT SPENT 2 HOURS TYPING THE CORRECTED 3/31/79 INVENTORY, AS ALL THE 
SIOUX FERTILIZER WITH TRI STATE RESULTS COLULDN'T JUSTIFY ANY CHEATING, LIKE THE PREVIOUS ACCOUNTANTS 6/30/77 $30,000 INVENTORY CHEAT AND QUICKLY ADDING THE $30,000 
ENDING BILLS ACCOUNTS PAYABLE THAT Always filled the shoebox of Sioux Fertilizer bill drawer), and I gave Bob Hoff, in from 3 to 5 seconds, the answer of $250,000 of 
more income, than what had been reported to the IRS. Then I started doing more accounting work and told Bob Hoff I needed the rest of dad's records that I had given him, 
which had been placed in his briefcase. Bob objected and I said I had put my duplicate cost accounting records in the back office room and that Jeff could use them to do
 Tri States accounting records but that dad needed the ones in bob's briefcase as they were Tri States records and the company was still his until paid for. seeing my 
continued insistence that they belonged to dad, he said, "HERE THEY ARE" AND, GETTING UP AND WALKING ABOUT 4 OR 5 FEET FROM HIS BACK DESK, HE RIPPED OPEN HIS 
BROWN PLASTIC BRIEFCASE BREAKING ONE OF THE LOCK LATCHES AND, REPEATEDLY, THREW MANY BUNCHES OF THE ORIGINAL TRI STATE ACCOUNTING RECORDS, THROWING THEM ALL ON THE 
FLOOR ABOUT 6 FEET FROM MY DESK, AT WHICH I GOT UP FROM MY THIRD (FROM THE BACK OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE OFFICE) DESK, AS ABOVE ALLUDED AND IMPLIED, AND PROCEEDED TO GATHER UP 
ALL THE ACCOUNTING RECORDS, THAT LATER IN MARCH 1987 TRI STATE TRIAL VS LORENTZ OPDAHL, were used to suggest strongly in denying that they (Lorentz Opdahl) the defendants
 have any valid and official records of Tri State”, but which at the time of my being fired, as above described, were placed in my briefcase and my backpack, as there were 
so many of them, and I took them out, most likely, the front door of the 218 N Phillips avenue office of Tri State Refining.

4. THE FOURTH OCCASION, REGARDING TRI STATE'S RECORDS, WAS BETWEEN VIRGIL VAN STELTON AND TOM OPDAHL SOMETIME AFTER RETURNING HOME FROM THE HALF-WAY HOUSE, PLYMOUTH LIFE 
AFTER BEING IN THE CHEROKEE MENTAL HOSPITAL WHERE THE CASE MANAGER SMUGGLY STATED THAT BILL GATES WILL NEVER BE INTERESTED IN YOUR RICO :LAWSUIT". VIRGIL VAN STELTON 
OBJECTED, SIMILARLY, THAT BILL GATES IS NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR RICO IN LATE 2001 OR EARLY 2002 AND ADDED BILL GATES DOES NOT KNOW YOU FROM ADAM. I REPLIED THAT EVENTUALLY 
I WANTED BILL GATES TO HAVE THE TRI STATE RECORDS IN MOSTLY DAD'S BRIEFCASE WITH A FEW IN BOB'S BRIEFCASE AND A FEW RECORDS IN MY BRIEFCASE; AND WHAT DIDN'T FIT INTO 
THE BRIEFCASES WAS PUT INTO A CARDBOARD BOX. BOTH HE AND DAD OBJECTED TO GIVING THEM EVENTUALLY TO MICROSOFT BUT INSTEAD THEY AGREED TO PUT THEM FOR SAFEKEEPING AT 
VIRGIL'S WHERE HE HAD THEM FOR 12 OR 13 YEARS UNTIL SHORTLY BEFORE MY BIRTHDAY IN FEBRUARY 2014. OVER A DECADE AGO, PROBABLY BILL GATES WASN'T INTERESTED IN MY RICO, 
BUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED DRAMATICALLY WITH THE ADDITIONAL 15,000 HOURS OF WORK PUT IN BY THIS CPA, FOREIGN BANK LIQUIDATOR, ESPECIALLY WITH THE VERY LAST INTRODUCTORY
 MAIN PLAINTIFF CONTRACT FOR "MILLIPEDES" OF WHICH THE ORIGINAL SCANNED FILE MEMORY STICK WAS INDIRECTLY SENT TO BILL GATES OF WHICH THE "MILLIPEDES" CONTRACT PROMISES
 TO MICROSOFT AND 58, SELECTED BY THIS CPA, MICROSOFT SUBSIDIARIES, A TOTAL OF ONE TRILLION, FIVE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS OF GOLD, CPA BANKING SYSTEM FUNDS, MINUS AN

1887 trillion dollars against a dozen jewish banking families who also has 1521 trillion dollars of mostly federal reserve bank gold certificates including one valued 
at 7 trillion dollars in 1998, of which GEORGE H W BUSH AND HIS SECRET SERVICE AGENTS MURDERED THE MAN WHO FOUND IT IN AN OLD BIBLE, BY SLOWLY DRAINING ALL THE 
BLOOD OUT OF HIS BODY, and of which is alloted to be sent or given, to the same RONN L JACKSON, three key very large and MASSIVE INTRODUCTORY MAIN PLAINTIFF CONTRACTS,
